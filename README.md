# Sustainability report of the Cell Death, Lysosomes and Artificial Intelligence Group - 2021
Our group has had sustainability guidelines and a sustainability consultant ([Tobias Hörnlein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-hörnlein-095a96112/))  for several years. As part of our sustainability efforts we will now also release sustainability reports every year. This document is the first draft and will be updated with additional information.

## Sustainability-related research
We aim to contribute to the sustainable development goals in all of our research. Our work contributes knowledge about cell death- and lysosome-related diseases which affect a large amount of the global population, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and COVID-19. We also do research related to understanding the effects of pollution. Pollution-induced disease is one of the most important global health issues, not least in low and middle income countries. In addition, we investigate pollution effects in other organisms. We also create AI-based tools for other researchers in medicine, life science and environmental research and consult and educate them about the uses, advantages and disadvantages of AI.

## Green computing
In an effort to minimize our negative footprint, we have educated ourselves about green computing and the negative impacts of using artificial intelligence. We have also started to  build up collaborations and apply for reserach funding to investigate this further. 

To understand the environmental impact of our computations, we have contacted the SNIC supercomputing infrastructures about their sustainablity status and activities. Unfortunately, the SNIC centres do not yet produce sustainability reports that would allow us to judge which supercomputing centre has the lowest negative impact and we therefore cannot yet direct our activities to a specifc infrastructure based on this. In the meantime, we have decided that we will at least track our computational use.

## Consumption and travel
We have since 2018, eliminated all printing, except for cases where it is absolutely required, e.g. for faculty documents. As we currently do not have laboratory operations, we also do not consume laboratory chemicals or plastic ware. Some computational equipment was purchased. This could not be bought second hand as the university currently has no agreement for that and we are bound by public procurement regulations. We have, however, raised this issue wherever possible and hope that the university will eventually get an agreement with that allows us to buy refurbished equipment when it is suitable.

Due to the pandemic, practically no work-related travel and commuting has occured in the past year. A few short-distance trips to outreach events had to be undertaken by car due to the risk of COVID-19 infection.

## Diversity and ethics
We are proud to be an extremely diverse research group uniting people of different genders, nationalities, cultural and religious backgrounds and educations (statistics are not reported due to privacy concerns). Through our scientific and outreach work we also have the privilege to interact with a great variety of people around the world from scientists to school kids and senior citizens. This diversity enriches our work and lives and is enshrined in our group and university policies, which forbid all forms of discrimination.

Regularly and openly discussing and highlighting ethical issues related to our research in medicine, environmental science and artificial intelligence is an important part of our work, for example in our group meetings, at outreach events or as part of our teaching. In addition, all our PhD students undergo ethics training. AI can do much good but it also comes with a negative environmental footprint, privacy and inequality concerns and transparancy issues which we try to address by working together across discipline borders, for example in AI Lund or through our interactions with sustainability researchers.

## Open science and education
Our group is very commited to open science and education. We share our code and data on github, publish all work as preprints or open access articles and regularly give open scientific talks about unpublished research. We have also contributed to the development of the Swedish COVID-19 dataportal that allows data and knowledge sharing.

In addition, we organize and participate in numerous open educational activities for different target groups, both in real life and online, and shared a broad range of educational materials from our courses and workshops with fellow researchers, teachers, students and the general public. Topics covered by our open education and outreach activities include AI in general, AI related to medicine/life science, AI related to sustainability and environmental science, python programming, other data science and higher education pedagogy. More material has been produced and is being processed for release.

In 2021, we have released our first citizen science project (https://github.com/Aitslab/openchart-se/) and are building up several more. In connection with this, we are also collaborating with the Vattenhallen science museum in Lund, where some of these will be placed. Sonja also acts as a consultant for the new Lund Science Centre museum (https://lundsciencecenter.se/), which is still under construction.

## Goals for 2022
### Green computing

Our goal for 2022 is to start tracking our computational usage more systematically so that we can evaluate its environmental impact and work towards reducing it. We are also trying to set up a research project related to this.

### Open science

Our goal is to share all code and data that can be released without privacy issues.

### Open education

Our goal is to share even more educational materials for teachers and students so that more people have access to high-quality education related to AI, medicine and sustainability.
