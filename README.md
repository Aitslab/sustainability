# Sustainability report of the Cell Death, Lysosomes and Artificial Intelligence Group - 2021
this report is under development

## Sustainability-related research
We aim to contribute to the sustainable development goals in all of our research. Our work contributes knowledge about cell death- and lysosome-related diseases which affect a large amount of the global population, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and COVID-19. We also do research related to environmental pollution, which is one of the most important global health issues, not least in low and middle income countries.

## Consumption
We have since 2018, eliminated all printing, except for cases where it is absolutely required, e.g. for faculty documents. As we currently do not have laboratory operations, we also do not consume laboratory chemicals or plastic ware.

## Diversity
We are proud to be an extremely diverse research group uniting people of different genders, nationalities, cultural and religious backgrounds and educations. Through our scientific and outreach work we also have the privilege to interact with a great variety of people around the world from scientists to school kids and senior citizens. This diversity enriches our work and lives and is enshrined in our group and university policies.

## Open science and education
Our group is dedicated to open science and education. We share our code and data on github, publish all work as preprints or open access articles and regularly give open scientific talks, which also include unpublished research. We have also contributed to the development of the COVID-19 dataportal.
In addition, we organize and participate in numerous open educational activities for different target groups, both in real life and online, and shared a broad range of educational materials from our courses and workshops with fellow researchers, teachers, students and the general public. Topics covered by our open education activities include AI in general, AI related to medicine/life science, AI related to sustainability and environmental science, python programming and other data science. More material has been produced and is being processed for release.

## Goals for 2022
### Green computing

Our goal for 2022 is to start tracking our computational usage more systematically so that we can evaluate its environmental impact and work towards reducing it.

### Open science

Our goal is to share all suitable code and data that can be released without privacy issues.

### Open education

Our goal is to share even more educational materials for teachers and students so that more people have access to high-quality education related to AI, medicine and sustainability.
