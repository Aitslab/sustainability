# Sustainability report of the Cell Death, Lysosomes and Artificial Intelligence Group - 2019-2021
Our group has had sustainability guidelines and a sustainability consultant ([Tobias Hörnlein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-hörnlein-095a96112/)) for several years and we continously educate ourselves in sustainability-related topics. As part of our sustainability efforts we will release sustainability reports every year. This document is the first draft and will be updated with additional information.

## Sustainability-related research
We aim to contribute to the sustainable development goals in all of our research. Our work contributes knowledge about cell death- and lysosome-related diseases which affect a large amount of the global population, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and COVID-19. We also do research related to understanding the effects of pollution and are part of the interdisciplinary research theme "The Air We Breathe 2.0" at the Pufendorf Instiute. Pollution-induced disease is one of the most important global health issues, not least in low and middle income countries. In addition, we investigate pollution effects in other organisms. We also create AI-based tools for other researchers in medicine, life science and environmental research and consult and educate them about the uses, advantages and disadvantages of AI.
To promote interdisciplinary science related to the SDGs, we have also organized seminars and workshops that aim to showcase interesting projects and promote collaborations (see below).

## Green computing
In an effort to minimize our group's footprint, we have educated ourselves about green labs and computing and the negative impacts of using artificial intelligence. We have also started to build up collaborations and apply for reserach funding to investigate this further. 

To understand the environmental impact of our computations, we have contacted the SNIC supercomputing infrastructures about their sustainablity status and activities. Unfortunately, the SNIC centres do not yet produce sustainability reports that would allow us to judge which supercomputing centre has the lowest negative impact and we therefore cannot yet direct our activities to a specifc infrastructure based on this. In the meantime, we have decided that we will at least track our computational use and facilitate the re-use of models in our group by establishing a model inventory.

## Consumption and travel
We have since 2018, eliminated all printing, except for cases where it is absolutely required, e.g. for faculty documents. As we currently do not have laboratory operations, we also do not consume laboratory chemicals or plastic ware. Some computational equipment was purchased. This could not be bought second hand as the university currently has no agreement in place and we are bound by public procurement regulations. We have, however, raised this issue in the Faculty's sustainability working group and wherever wlese possible and hope that the university will eventually get an agreement that allows us to buy refurbished equipment where it is suitable.

Due to the pandemic, practically no work-related travel and commuting has occured during 2021. A few short-distance trips to outreach events had to be undertaken by car due to the risk of COVID-19 infection.

## Diversity and ethics
We are proud to be an extremely diverse research group uniting people of different genders, nationalities, cultural and religious backgrounds and educations (statistics are not reported due to privacy concerns). Through our scientific and outreach work we also have the privilege to interact with a great variety of people around the world from scientists to school kids and senior citizens. This diversity enriches our work and lives and is enshrined in our group and university policies, which forbid all forms of discrimination.

Regularly and openly discussing and highlighting ethical issues related to our research in medicine, environmental science and artificial intelligence is an important part of our work, for example in our group meetings or at outreach events. In addition, all our PhD students undergo ethics training and we include ethics topics in all of our AI-related teaching. AI can do much good but it also comes with a negative environmental footprint, privacy and inequality concerns and transparancy issues which we try to address by working together across discipline borders, for example in AI Lund or through our interactions with sustainability researchers.

## Open science and education
Our group is very commited to open science and education. We share our code and data on github, publish all work as preprints or open access articles and regularly give open scientific talks about unpublished research. We have also contributed to the development of the Swedish COVID-19 dataportal that allows data and knowledge sharing.

In addition, we organize and participate in numerous open educational activities for different target groups, both in real life and online, and shared a broad range of educational materials from our courses and workshops with fellow researchers, teachers, students and the general public. Topics covered by our open education and outreach activities include AI in general, AI related to medicine/life science, AI related to sustainability and environmental science, python programming, other data science and higher education pedagogy. More material has been produced and is being processed for release.

In 2021, we have released our first citizen science project (https://github.com/Aitslab/openchart-se/) and are building up several more. In connection with this, we are also collaborating with the Vattenhallen science museum in Lund, where some of these will be placed. Sonja also acts as a consultant for the new Lund Science Centre museum (https://lundsciencecenter.se/), which is still under construction.

## Partnerships and raising awareness
Through our involvement in COMPUTE, AI Lund, the Faculty of Medicine sustainability working groups and the Pufendorf Theme "The Air We Breathe 2.0" we have formed several new partnerships with other researchers who share our sustainability-related goals and want to work together and exchange knowledge and tools. We have also established interactions with sustainability-related research environments at LU (Agenda 2030 Research School, CEC, MERGE, ClimBEco, Sustainability Forum and BECC). In addition, ve formed new collaborations with medical research groups. With some of these new partners we have initiated joint projects or written joint applications for SDG-related projects already, and we plan for additional activities in 2022.

We have also organized a series of events related to "AI and sustainability" to better connect the AI, health and sustainability communities at LU (see above), showcase interesting science and promote discussion. Most of these activities were organized through our involvement in COMPUTE, AI Lund, HubAI and the Pufendorf Theme "The Air We Breathe 2.0" and we have also cooperated with the Agenda 2030 Reesarch school and sustainability communities at LU. In addition, we are contributing to the implementation of the Faculty of Medicine Sustainability Action Plan as part of the working groups "Active collaboration" and "Resources and Tools" and we have initiated discussions about sustainability efforts and potential certification on the department board.

During fall 2021, Sonja was also part of the Theme "The Air We Breathe 2.0" at the Pufendorf Institute

## Goals for 2022

### Sustainability-related research
We will continue our research at the intersection of medicine, environmental science and AI and aim to publish several findings during 2022.

### Green computing
Our goal is to implement systematic tracking of our computational usage and model development so that we can evaluate its environmental impact and work towards reducing it, e.g. by model re-use and sharing. We also aim to set up a research project where we evaluate the sustainability of the type of AI tools we develop.

### Consumption and travel
Our goal is to implement systematic tracking of our work-related consumption and travel so that we can evaluate its environmental impact and work towards reducing it. For all travel and consumption, sustainability is to be used as one of the primary selection criteria.

### Diversity and ethics
We will continue to promote diversity and ethical research through teaching and outreach activities and inside our group.

### Open science and education
Our goal is to share code and data with each paper published about our research. In addition, we plan to launch citizen science projects related to computer vision and natural language processing.
We also aim to publish additional educational materials so that more people have access to high-quality education related to AI, medicine and sustainability. This will include publication of lectures and material from the "AI in Medicine and Life Science" courses. 

### Partnerships and raising awareness
During 2022, we aim to deepen our ties to other researchers who share our goals, with joint research projects, applications and other activities. We will also continue to raise awareness for sustainability in any suitable context and organize activities that connect the sustainability, health and computational communities on a local, national and international level.
